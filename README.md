<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->

## Concept Process

I did some research on apps similar to this one looking for some inspiration for design. I then built some mockups and played around until I was happy with the design.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

I started with the design of the application. Building the different screens and making sure it all looked good. I then set up the navigation to move through the application. Then finally i started working on the functionality of the app.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

- Made use of both `functionality` to implement a specific feature.
- `MVC/MVVM` design architecture implemented.
- `Plugin` for this.
- ETC.

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- I really enjoyed getting the chat system working, It's the first time I've built something like it so seeing it work was awesome.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- My main Bug was the profile screen. The app would crash everytime i'd navigate to that screen. I did some research and found there was a typo.

### Reviews & Testing

<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I would like to add functionality to be able to create more groups.
- With the ability to add more groups I would like to make some adjustments to the design a little to accomodate this update.
